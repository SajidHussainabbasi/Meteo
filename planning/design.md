# Design

## Project's Design Overview

The **Meteo** app provides a clean, informative, and responsive user interface to display 10-day hourly weather forecasts using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/). The app presents weather data grouped by day, each with a list of hourly temperature readings, allowing users to plan ahead based on precise forecast information.

- **Simple, Card-Based Layout**: Each dayâ€™s forecast is displayed in its own weather card, showing the date and hourly temperatures.
- **Responsive Grid**: Cards adjust automatically to screen sizes using CSS Grid.
- **Modular & Maintainable**: The app follows a modular architecture with separated logic (API calls, rendering, event listeners).
- **User-Centered Design**: Focus on clarity, readability, and accessibility for users on desktop or mobile.
